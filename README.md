SMSmemtest
==========

SMSmemtest is a program for the SEGA Master System and SEGA Game Gear (in SMS mode) to test the perfect memory functionality.

It performs some basic tests on all the internal 8 KB system RAM and the 16 KB Video RAM, reporting results after that.

This is work-in-progress, more advanced tests will be added.
